        <title>Finally, details about our June event</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Yes, there will be a June event! Better late than never, we’re running the next Style &amp;amp; Class on June 16th at Mobify.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As core languages of the web, we’re well familiar with HTML and CSS. Are they necessarily just production languages, or can they deliver creative freedom? Come find out.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Our April Event</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Many of us spend our days designing for things we aren’t necessarily passionate about. Design is our job. And that doesn’t mean we don’t love doing it and that we aren’t excited. But it’s also not really what we care about. Instead, we turn to passion projects on our off time to really show off what we care about. Please join us as we spend an evening taking a look at what it means to be passionate about your design work and the amazing things that can come out of it.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Our February Event</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Join us for an evening of 4 short talks of design storytelling. During your career you’ll experience defining moments that stand out in your memory. Sometimes these moments are funny, sometimes they make you think, and every now and then you learn a valuable lesson that informs the rest of your career. Our speakers will share some of their own defining moments and the lessons those moments can teach us.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Style &amp; Class finally has a website?!</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The irony isn’t lost on us. After a year of great meetups about building the web as well as a full conference, that Style &amp;amp; Class existed as mostly a Meetup group without its own permanent home on the web.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, we’re finally fixing that today. We’ve been hard at work over the past month building this site. It’s about 90% of the way there,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We see this new site as a necessary first step toward a much expanded Style &amp;amp; Class. The &lt;a href=&quot;/about/organizers/&quot;&gt;organizing committee&lt;/a&gt; has only started discussing what comes next, so while we can’t be more than vague right now, you should expect more announcements over the coming months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, head on over to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.meetup.com/styleandclass/&quot;&gt;our Meetup page&lt;/a&gt; for future event details.&lt;/p&gt;
