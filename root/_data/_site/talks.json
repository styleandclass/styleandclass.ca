We strip down our content to a bare minimum in pursuit of misguided ideals about mobile context. We provide ‘useful’ mobile UI components that immediately proceed to get in a user’s way. We make improper assumptions about a user’s environment. Let’s place some of these mobile design anti-patterns under the microscope and talk about why they don’t work, and what we should be doing instead.",

Understanding how to represent content priorities consistently for RWD is like solving a puzzle that keeps changing, and I love puzzles. Content modeling helps us define the content creation, design, and user experience for a new site. It is especially important for the responsive web. Because layout and user context is constantly changing, it's important to make sure content priorities are represented consistently. So grab a sharpie and let's do some modeling!",
